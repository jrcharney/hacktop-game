Repo for Hacktop: The Game for GGJ15

## My computer is broken!
Help piece the computer back together in the order they are assembled: Lapdock, Odroid (R), Voltage Regulator, Battery.  More parts will be added to make the levels more challenging.

Help find these parts burried under a pile of crumpled papers and receipts in this 2D push-tile game!  And do it quickly before the Global Game Jam Presentation!

Collect SD Cards for points!  Find Velcro(tm) tape and Cables, and event alternative power sources in the higher levels!

Hurry!  Before the GGJ Guys find out!
