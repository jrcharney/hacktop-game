                             What I can do is offer you my website and the story of this game.

                      It's about a guy who built a hacktop, went to the bathroom.
                      Returned to find it taken out to the parking lot and blown up by overzealous cops
                      who mistook it for a bomb.  Why is everything cool looking look explosive?!




                      This is why we can't have nice things!

         At any rate, you see a junkyard where you can build a new lapdock if you find the parts
         in the junkyard.  Avoid Killer Robots, Complete missions. Make cool future stuff that
         looks dangerous but is really cool...like a pitbull puppy!



         (Say "Puppy!"  It will make you smile.)

          It won't be texty like this.  Unless you want it like that...maybe I'll make a mini game.


          It's actually going to be a lot like Jetpac (Sinclair ZX Spectrum from the 1980s!)
          and Rodent's Revenge (Windows Entertainment pack, late 1980s)
