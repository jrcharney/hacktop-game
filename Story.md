## Plot

HORRAY! It's Global Game Jam time! You are looking forward to your first GGJ and to showing off your Hacktop made of a hodgepoge of parts.

All those energy drinks have made you gassy and eager to go on a pee break!

As you releave yourself, someone not familiar with your device mistakens it for a bomb, and everyone is evacuated from the building.
Even though you try to tell the police your computer is not a bomb, the police still hyped up on adrenaline from the latest unrest in Ferguson calls in the Bomb and Arson Squad and blows up your computer.
Generally this process is done by using other explosives to explode alledged explosives.

Unfortunately, the rookie BAS guy used too much TNT and rather than keeping the parts in the explosion container, 
blows all your computer parts into a nearby junkyard speciallizeing in electronics recycling 
that is now burried under feet of  old paper receipts like the ones that accumulate on your desk every week from running errands, 
during a wind storm no less.

The guy who owns the junk yard says he might have parts to make a new hacktop and more parts to make it better
now that the original parts are blown to smitherines.

However to get to those parts, you must push those papers around in a carved labryth that must be made by pushing rows of these towering,
but light, paper stacks.  To help you rember what parts you need, you generally like to assemble everything in a sequential order
starting with the lapdock, then the microcomputer, then the voltage regulator, and finally the battery.

But your presentation is soon so get a move on!

## Action

Pushing the paper stacks, carve a path to get the four part you need to piece together your computer before time runs out.

Watch out for obsticals. Avoid blocking in pieces. (You'll lose points and some good parts!)

## Levels
As the game progresses, more parts will be needed.  Especially if you want to build other things or make improvements with the extra time you have.

## Obstacles
* Fans - fans can blow paper stacks back where they were after a while.
* Glass - Glass Shards can cut your hands!  Cost you health.  You don't want to lose health and go to the hospital!
* Garbage - Garbage makes your gloves smell. Cost you armor as you pick through the trash.

## Health and Armor
* Band-aids - Cover up those boo-boos!
* Work Gloves - Great for protecting yourself. 

## Achievements

### X-Files Mission
SD Cards contain information.  It's great to learn. BECAUSE KNOWLEDGE IS POWER!
* __Chelsa Manning__ - Find enough old SD Cards to find a Wikileak!
* __Julian Assange__ - Find enough old SD Cards to fill a website full of Wiki Leaks!
* __Edward Snowden__ - Find enough old SD Cards to ruin the new Star Wars Film before President Obama can see it.

* __Stephen T. Colbert__ - Find enough old SD Cards to become IMMORTAL!

### Energy vs. Health Mission
Too many energy drinks at one time will make you bloated and gassy and will make you pee green which will cost health points! So use these items sparingly!
* __Crystal Pepsi__ - Right Now, you are thinking of that Van Halen song from 1993.  Cans become Crystal Pepsi, but I wouldn't recommend drinking soda that is 20 years old.
* __Nawgin__ - Ugh! That is nasty. It's like the Bud Light of Energy Drinks.  Good for a short boost in speed though.
* __Do the Dew!__ - Collect enough Energy Drinks for another energy level boost.  Energy Drinks will look like Mountain Dew Cans. (Don't sue me, Pepsi!)
* __Bing__ - A Cherry Flavored Energy Drink, but it needs to lose a lot of unatural ingreediants. Energy Drinks will look like Bing Cans.
* __Give me a Jolt!__ - Collect Enough Energy Drinks that cans look like Jolt Cola!
* __It give me WIIIIIINGS!!!__ - Collect Enough Energy Drinks that the cans look like Red Bull cans. Lightly carbonated.
* __Surgerunner!__ - Collect enough Energy Drinks, for another energy level boost. SURGE IS BACK, BABY!  See them as Energy Drink items.
